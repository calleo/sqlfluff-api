# SQL Formatter Chrome Extension API

This repository contains the code which the SQL Formatter Chrome extension
uses to turn ugly SQL into pretty SQL.

This is deployed as a Rest-API, which the Chrome extension communicates with. All 
formatting is done by the API and which uses SQL Fluff to do the actual formatting.
